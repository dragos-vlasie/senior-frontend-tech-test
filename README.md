# Ffern Friends Form

This project is a **Senior Frontend Technical Test** for Ffern. It includes a page where influencers can enter their shipping details to receive a fragrance.

## Features

- A form for collecting user shipping information (name, address, city, etc.)
- Data validation using **Zod**
- Form state management with **React Query** for handling form submission and API requests
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Ffern Link Example:

## Improvements I'd Make with More Time

- **Tailwind Variables**: Instead of hardcoding colors in the components, I would create custom Tailwind variables for color consistency across the app.
- Create json file to store all the data and create all the components based on that
